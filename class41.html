<h1 ><center>Displaying and positioning of an element</center></h1>
<p style="display: inline;">
    Some of the CSS display values which are commonly used. <br> <br>
    1. tesdisplay: inline;
    inline element takes the required width only. It doesn't force the line 
    break so the flow of text doesn't break in inline example. <br> 
</p> 
<p style="display: inline-block;">
    2. display: inline-block;
    CSS display inline-block element is very similar to inline element but 
    the difference is that you are able to set the width and height<br>
</p>
<p style="display: block;">


    3. display: block;
    CSS display block element takes as much as horizontal space as they
    can. Means the block element takes the full available width. They 
    make a line break before and after them.<br>
</p>
<p style="display: none;">

4. display: none;
The "none" value totally removes the element from the page. It will 
not take any space
</p>
<h1>Positioning of an Element</h1>
<p>


1. Static
This is a by default position for HTML elements. It always positions 
an element according to the normal flow of the page. It is not 
affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties.<br>
</p>
<p style="position: fixed;">
2. Fixed
The fixed positioning property helps to put the text fixed on the 
browser. This fixed test is positioned relative to the browser window, 
and doesn't move even you scroll the window.<br>
</p>
<p>
3. Relative 
The relative positioning property is used to set the element relative to 
its normal position.</p><br>
<p>
4. Absolute
The absolute positioning is used to position an element relative to the
first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such 
element is found, the containing block is HTML.
With the absolute positioning, you can place an element anywhere on 
a page.<br>
</p>
<p>
5. Sticky
The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position<br>

    Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒi.u]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa,[a] was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire,[b] at the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. 
    The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day.

    Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."[7]
    
    Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.
